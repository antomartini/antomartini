:blossom: I'm Anto, I am 26. and I really like to explore, innovate and create new things. 

:computer: I am a computer engineering. Currently, I work as a developer (and in constant training). :atom: React/React Native!

:balloon: I love animals. I love reading. I am a fan of the series. 

:purple_heart: I fight for a more diverse a inclusive world. In a world of ones and zeros, we go for diversity.

:maple_leaf: My hair is generally a mess. I like taking photos of nature and looking at the moon.
